# Project Context

- **Owner:** Brady
- **Project:** squad-sdk — the programmable multi-agent runtime for GitHub Copilot (v1 replatform)
- **Stack:** TypeScript (strict mode, ESM-only), Node.js ≥20, @github/copilot-sdk, Vitest, esbuild
- **Created:** 2026-02-21

## Learnings

### From Beta (carried forward)
- Strict mode non-negotiable: strict: true, noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true, no @ts-ignore
- Declaration files are public API — treat .d.ts as contracts
- Generics over unions for recurring patterns
- ESM-only: no CJS shims, no dual-package hazards
- Build pipeline: esbuild for bundling, tsc for type checking
- Public API: src/index.ts exports everything — this is the contract surface

### SDK npm swap (M0 blocker)
- Swapped `@github/copilot-sdk` from `file:../copilot-sdk/nodejs` (v0.1.8) to npm `^0.1.25`
- Kept in `optionalDependencies` to preserve zero-dependency CLI scaffolding path
- Build clean, 1592/1592 tests passed — no code changes needed, only package.json + lockfile
- PR #271, branch `squad/190-sdk-npm-dependency`, closes #190, #193, #194

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-21T21:23Z): SDK dependency can be swapped from file: to npm reference — decided by Kujan
The `file:../copilot-sdk/nodejs` reference can be upgraded to `"@github/copilot-sdk": "^0.1.25"` (already published on npm with SLSA attestations). This is a one-line change; build and all 1592 tests verified to pass. This unblocks npm publish and removes CI sibling-directory dependency.

### M1 Monorepo scaffold (#197, #198, #200)
- Added `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` to root package.json
- Created `packages/squad-sdk/package.json` — `@bradygaster/squad-sdk`, ESM-only, exports map with types-first condition, `@github/copilot-sdk` as real dependency (not optional — SDK owns this dep now)
- Created `packages/squad-cli/package.json` — `@bradygaster/squad-cli`, bin entry, workspace dep on SDK
- npm uses version-string workspace references (`"0.6.0-alpha.0"`) not `workspace:*` protocol (that's pnpm/Yarn)
- Build clean, 1592/1592 tests still pass — no source files moved, scaffold only
- PR #274, branch `squad/197-monorepo-scaffold`, closes #197, #198, #200

### CLI entry point split (#187)
- Moved `main()` and all CLI bootstrap code from `src/index.ts` to `src/cli-entry.ts`
- `src/index.ts` is now a pure re-export barrel with zero side effects — safe for library import
- `VERSION` stays exported from `index.ts` (public API); `cli-entry.ts` imports it
- `SquadError` added to barrel exports so library consumers can catch CLI errors
- `cli-entry.ts` imports `VERSION` from `./index.js` — no duplicate constant
- Build clean, 1683/1683 tests pass
- Branch `squad/181-squadui-p0`, closes #187

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T020714Z): CLI entry point split complete
Edie's refactor split src/index.ts into pure barrel (zero side effects) and src/cli-entry.ts (CLI routing + main). SquadUI can now safely import @bradygaster/squad as a library without triggering process.exit() on import. Decision merged to decisions.md. Issue #187 closed. 1683 tests passing. Related: Kujan's process.exit() refactor.

### Subpath exports (#227)
- Added 7 subpath exports to `packages/squad-sdk/package.json`: `.`, `./parsers`, `./types`, `./config`, `./skills`, `./agents`, `./cli`
- Every export uses types-first condition ordering (`"types"` before `"import"`) per Node.js resolution algorithm
- All source barrels verified: `src/parsers.ts`, `src/types.ts`, `src/config/index.ts`, `src/skills/index.ts`, `src/agents/index.ts`, `src/cli/index.ts`
- All dist artifacts confirmed after build: `.js` + `.d.ts` for each subpath
- Build clean, 1719/1719 tests pass
- Branch `squad/181-squadui-p2`, closes #227

### Build system migration (monorepo tsconfig + package.json)
- Converted root `tsconfig.json` to base config with `"files": []` and project references to both workspace packages
- SDK `tsconfig.json`: extends root, `composite: true`, `declarationMap: true`, `include: ["src/**/*.ts"]` — no JSX
- CLI `tsconfig.json`: extends root, `composite: true`, `jsx: "react-jsx"`, `jsxImportSource: "react"`, includes `*.tsx`, project reference to SDK
- SDK `package.json`: 18 subpath exports (Keaton's plan), `@github/copilot-sdk` as dependency, `@types/node` + `typescript` as devDeps
- CLI `package.json`: `bin.squad` → `./dist/cli-entry.js`, added `ink`, `react` deps, `@types/react`, `esbuild`, `ink-testing-library` devDeps, `templates/` in files array
- Root `package.json`: stripped to workspace orchestrator — `private: true`, no `main`/`types`/`bin`, no runtime deps, only `typescript` + `vitest` in devDeps, build script delegates to `--workspaces`
- `composite: true` required in both packages for TypeScript project references to work — without it, `tsc --build` cannot resolve cross-package references
- Build clean: both `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` and `@bradygaster/squad-cli` compile with zero errors

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T041800Z): Build system migration complete, all 6 config files fixed, zero TypeScript errors — decided by Edie
Edie fixed root tsconfig (base config + project refs), SDK tsconfig (composite + no JSX), CLI tsconfig (composite + jsx), root package.json (workspace orchestrator), SDK package.json (18 subpath exports), CLI package.json (bin entry + UI deps). Composite builds enable TypeScript project references across packages. All dist artifacts (`.js`, `.d.ts`, `.d.ts.map`) emitted correctly. Build ready for Phase 3 (test import migration when root src/ removal blocks).

### Fix workspace:* → npm-compatible wildcard
- Previous commit used `workspace:*` for CLI→SDK dependency — this is pnpm/Yarn syntax, not npm
- npm workspaces reject `workspace:` protocol with `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL`
- Changed to `"*"` which achieves the same local resolution under npm workspaces
- Verified: `npm install` succeeds, `npm run build` compiles both packages cleanly
- Also verified: prepublishOnly scripts and dynamic VERSION (via createRequire) from previous commit are working correctly

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T070156Z): npm workspace protocol decision merged, test import migration complete, barrel conventions finalized — decided by Edie, Fenster, Hockney
- **npm workspace protocol (Decision):** Use `"*"` version string for CLI→SDK dependency, not pnpm's `workspace:*`. npm workspaces auto-resolve local packages by name regardless of version specifier.
- **Test import migration (Decision):** 56 test files successfully migrated from `../src/` to `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` / `@bradygaster/squad-cli` package paths. 26 SDK subpath exports + 16 CLI subpath exports. All 1727 tests passing. Vitest resolves through compiled `dist/`.
- **Barrel file conventions (Decision):** `src/parsers.ts` and `src/types.ts` created as public API barrels — parsers re-export all functions + types, types exports ONLY types (zero runtime imports). Both follow ESM barrel pattern.
- **All decisions merged to decisions.md.** Status: Production-ready, awaiting Phase 3 SDK session integration for final runtime wiring.
