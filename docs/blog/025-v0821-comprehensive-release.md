## What Shipped

### 1. SDK-First Mode (Phase 1)

Define your entire AI team in TypeScript—agents, routing, ceremonies, governance—with full type safety. No manual YAML. No schema files.

**Eight builder functions:**

- `defineTeam()` — Team metadata, project context, member roster
- `defineAgent()` — Agent role, model, tools, capabilities
- `defineRouting()` — Pattern-based routing with tiers and priorities
- `defineCeremony()` — Ceremony scheduling (standups, retros)
- `defineHooks()` — Governance hooks (write guards, blocked commands, PII scrubbing)
- `defineCasting()` — Casting configuration (universe allowlists, overflow strategy)
- `defineTelemetry()` — OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- `defineSquad()` — Top-level config composition

**`squad build` command:**

```bash
squad build              # Compile squad.config.ts to .squad/ markdown
squad build --check     # Validate without writing
squad build --dry-run   # Preview what would be generated
```

Generates `.squad/team.md`, `.squad/routing.md`, agent charters, ceremonies. Protected files (`.squad/decisions.md`, `.squad/history.md`) are **never overwritten**.

**Quick start:**

```typescript
import {
  defineSquad,
  defineTeam,
  defineAgent,
  defineRouting,
} from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk';

export default defineSquad({
  team: defineTeam({
    name: 'My Squad',
    description: 'Multi-agent review pipeline',
    projectContext: 'Content analysis',
    members: ['tone-reviewer', 'tech-reviewer', 'copy-editor'],
  }),

  agents: [
    defineAgent({
      name: 'tone-reviewer',
      role: 'Tone Analyst',
      model: 'claude-sonnet-4',
      tools: ['grep', 'view'],
      capabilities: [
        { name: 'content-analysis', level: 'expert' },
      ],
    }),
    // ... more agents
  ],

  routing: defineRouting({
    rules: [
      {
        pattern: 'tone-*',
        agents: ['tone-reviewer'],
        tier: 'direct',
        priority: 1,
      },
    ],
    defaultAgent: 'tone-reviewer',
  }),
});
```

Then:

```bash
npm install @bradygaster/squad-sdk
npx squad build
```

See [SDK-First Mode Guide](../sdk-first-mode.md) for full documentation.

### 2. Remote Squad Mode

Cross-machine squad collaboration via new `squad rc` commands for linking project-local squads to remote team roots.

**New commands:**

- `squad rc` — Show remote config status
- `squad init-remote` — Initialize with remote team root config
- `squad rc-tunnel` — Establish remote connection

**Key concepts:**

- `resolveSquadPaths()` dual-root resolver — project-local vs team identity directories
- `squad doctor` — 9-check setup validation with emoji output
- `squad link <path>` — link a project to a remote team root
- `ensureSquadPathDual()` / `ensureSquadPathResolved()` — dual-root write guards

Remote Squad Mode enables teams to share squad identity across multiple projects while maintaining project-local customization.

### 3. Critical Bug Fixes

#### **Installation Crash Fix (#247)** — The Big One

**Problem:** `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli` was crashing on fresh installs with:

```
Error: Cannot find module '@opentelemetry/api'
```

**Root cause:** `@opentelemetry/api` was a hard dependency that failed to resolve in npx's isolated install environment, causing the entire CLI to fail immediately.

**Fix:** 

1. Created `otel-api.ts` resilient wrapper with full no-op fallbacks
2. Moved OTel to optional dependencies (not required by default)
3. Telemetry now gracefully degrades when OTel is absent — zero crashes

**Impact:** Fresh installs now work reliably. Telemetry is truly optional.

---

#### **CLI Command Wiring (#244)**

Four commands were implemented but never wired into the CLI entry point:

- `rc`
- `copilot-bridge`
- `init-remote`
- `rc-tunnel`

**Fix:** Commands are now properly connected and accessible via `squad rc`, `squad copilot-bridge`, etc.

**Impact:** Remote squad features are now discoverable and functional.

---

#### **Model Config Round-Trip (#245)**

**Problem:** `AgentDefinition.model` didn't accept structured model configuration — only strings.

**Fix:** 

- `AgentDefinition.model` now accepts `string | ModelPreference` for advanced configuration
- Charter compiler updated to emit and parse the new format correctly
- Round-trip config survives compile → parse → serialize cycles intact

**Impact:** Advanced model selection (fallback chains, cost-aware routing) now works end-to-end.

---

#### **ExperimentalWarning Suppression**

**Problem:** Node's `ExperimentalWarning` for `node:sqlite` was leaking into terminal output, cluttering user experience.

**Fix:** Process.emit override in `cli-entry.ts` filters experimental warnings before they reach stdout.

**Impact:** Clean, focused terminal output.

---

#### **Blankspace Fix (#239)**

**Problem:** Idle blank space appeared below the agent panel even when no output was present.

**Fix:** Conditional height constraint only active during processing. Removes visual clutter.

**Impact:** Cleaner UI, professional appearance.

---

### 4. Test Hardening

#### **Windows Race Condition (EBUSY)**

Race condition in `fs.rm` with retry logic on Windows. Fixed with exponential backoff and resource cleanup.

#### **Speed Gate Adjustments**

Test speed gate thresholds adjusted for growing CLI codebase. No more false-positive timeout failures.

---

### 5. Regression Fix Wave (#221)

**Massive batch:** PR #221 resolved 25 test regressions across the suite. CRLF normalization, cross-platform path handling, and mock cleanup.

---

### 6. CI Stabilization (#232, #228)

GitHub Actions pipeline fixed and green. All workflows now run reliably without transient failures.

---

### 7. Community Contributions

- **PR #199 (migration command)** — Received, reviewed, and feedback captured as issue #231 for future implementation
- **PR #243 (blankspace fix)** — Community contribution cherry-picked and credited

## Technical Details

### SDK Mode Detection

The coordinator auto-detects SDK-First mode:

```typescript
if (fs.existsSync(resolve('.', 'squad.config.ts'))) {
  // SDK-First mode active
  // Coordinator uses compiled markdown + SDK awareness
}
```

Fallback to traditional markdown-first mode if `squad.config.ts` is missing (backward compatible).

### Telemetry Architecture (OTel Resilience)

New `otel-api.ts` wrapper ensures telemetry is truly optional:

```typescript
// otel-api.ts
export function initTelemetry(config?: TelemetryConfig) {
  try {
    const otel = require('@opentelemetry/api');
    return otel.trace.getTracer('squad', config?.version);
  } catch (err) {
    // Graceful no-op when OTel is absent
    return {
      startSpan: () => ({ end: () => {} }),
      // ... more no-op methods
    };
  }
}
```

**Benefit:** Telemetry is an optional add-on, not a blocker.

### Remote Squad Path Resolution

Dual-root resolver supports both project-local and team-identity directories:

```typescript
function resolveSquadPaths(projectRoot: string, remoteTeamRoot?: string) {
  // Check project-local first: {projectRoot}/.squad/
  // Fallback to remote: {remoteTeamRoot}/.squad/
  // Load routing, teams, charters from first match
}
```

## Documentation Updates

### New Guides

- **[SDK-First Mode](../sdk-first-mode.md)** — Comprehensive guide covering concepts, builder reference, patterns, and when to use SDK-First vs. markdown-only
- **[SDK Reference](../reference/sdk.md)** — Full builder function signatures, type definitions, runtime validation rules, and examples

### What Changed

- README includes quick reference for SDK-First teams
- CHANGELOG updated with Phase 1 + bug fix deliverables
- All sample code demonstrates the builder pattern
- Blog post (this document) serves as release announcement

---

## Testing & Stability

**Test Coverage (v0.8.21 focus areas):**

- 36 builder function tests — validates runtime type guards for each builder
- 24 build command tests — `--check`, `--dry-run`, protected file guards
- 29 markdown↔SDK conversion round-trip tests
- 25 regression tests fixed from PR #221
- 2 Windows EBUSY race condition tests (fs.rm retry logic)
- 13 known timeout flakes on Windows (non-logic, environment-related)

**Total test suite:** 3,724 passing tests (3,740 total, 0 logic failures)

---

## What We Learned

1. **Type safety is UX.** SDK-First developers get autocomplete and catch configuration errors at edit time, not runtime. This pays for itself immediately.

2. **Optional dependencies unlock resilience.** Moving OTel to optional eliminated the installation crash entirely. Telemetry should be an add-on, not a blocker.

3. **Windows needs dedicated testing.** Race conditions in `fs.rm`, CRLF normalization, and timeout thresholds are distinct from Unix environments. CI/CD must test both.

4. **Protected files are critical.** `.squad/decisions.md` and `.squad/history.md` must never be overwritten by generated files. This ensures human-written knowledge persists across recompiles.

## What's Coming Next

### v0.8.22 (Roadmap)

- `squad init --sdk` flag — opt-in to SDK-First mode during initialization (#249)
- `squad migrate` command — convert existing markdown squads to SDK-First (#250)
- Comprehensive SDK-First documentation expansion (#251)

### Phase 2: Live Reload (SDK-First)

- `squad build --watch` fully implemented — hot reload of squad.config.ts changes
- Agents re-spawn with new config without restarting the CLI
- Decision file merging strategies for concurrent edits

### Phase 3: OpenTelemetry Integration (Unblocked)

- `defineTelemetry()` config → live instrumentation
- Agents export metrics and traces to Prometheus, Jaeger, and Datadog
- Cost tracking per agent (token spend, wall-clock time)
- Performance dashboards in Squad CLI (`squad aspire`)

### Beyond v0.8.21

- **Builder linting:** `squad lint` validates config against best practices
- **Config versioning:** `squad config migrate` helpers for breaking changes
- **Casting system integration:** `defineCasting()` → live universe selection

---

## Upgrade Path

### From v0.8.20 → v0.8.21

```bash
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli@latest
# Or in your project:
npm install --save-dev @bradygaster/squad-cli@latest
```

**SDK-First Mode is opt-in.** Existing markdown-based squads continue to work without changes.

### Fresh Install (Crash Fix Benefit)

If you've had issues with `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli` on fresh machines, v0.8.21 resolves the OTel dependency crash:

```bash
npx @bradygaster/squad-cli@latest doctor
# Now works reliably without dependency resolution errors
```

### To Migrate to SDK-First (Optional)

1. Create `squad.config.ts` with builder functions
2. Run `squad build --dry-run` to preview generated files
3. Run `squad build` to generate `.squad/` markdown
4. Commit the config, version control the generated files, and sync your team

Alternatively, keep your markdown-first squad — both modes will coexist indefinitely.
